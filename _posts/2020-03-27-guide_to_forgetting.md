## A Guide to Forgetting
#### Isaac Feldman

![the house before being demolished, an aging, brick, split-level home](/../media/house.png/)

I moved from my childhood home in 2016. 15 of the 19 short years of my life all took place there: family dinners, game nights, fruitless reorganizing. It was all changing. We were going to move, and the old house was to be demolished. My parents had always wanted to be in a house big enough for four and a dog. I wasn’t convinced a new house would be any better, but I had little choice: teenagers don’t sign mortgages.

This Sunday afternoon, my sister and I set out to make our final mark on the place. Armed with cans of spray-paint, we marched into our barren rooms and got to work. My sister, who is more artistically inclined, sketched a drawing in black on her pastel pink walls while I skipped the art in favor of my signature. Stretching the long, yellow wall of my room, I had claimed the room finally mine on the last day I could ever be inside it. My sister and I had shared this room for 10 years: first in the same crib and eventually different beds until she moved out. I could still see the indentation in the weathered blue carpet from where my bedframe once sat. The paint dripped down the molding to meet the impression.

I felt a pained happiness. All my life was here, soon to be crushed to dust, but I was off to somewhere new. When I was walking out the door for the last time, I made a promise to myself, signed in black spray-paint, that I wouldn’t forget. I am determined that the inside of my skull will be bounded, secretly, by yellow drywall and blue carpet forever.

“But if the bathroom was on the left, then where the hell was the laundry room?!”

My sister and I lived in the same house in Virginia, but that house doesn’t exist anymore. Now we are arguing about where the bathroom in the basement was. After all this time, I knew the bathroom was on the right, but she said it was on the left. We both swore we remembered. After all, teenagers aren’t allowed to forget things like this, that job is for my grandma or my grandpa. Then the bathroom must be in a state of quantum superposition: both on the left and the right, and the laundry room phasing in and out of existence only popping back in when I moved clothes to the dryer! We deferred to our parents. My dad assured us that the laundry room was, in fact, on the left of the basement hallway and the bathroom was straight ahead at the end of the hall.

The conversation was over, but not the confusion. How could I have forgotten? How could I have broken my promise? Sitting face up in my bigger bed, I tried to recall every detail I could about the house: every electrical outlet, every color, every stubbed toe on the leg of a table. It came back in chunks, but with big gaps. The basement couch was maroon, but I don’t know what the wall was. I could see important memories, but not the details I promised myself I would remember. 

I had thrown away most of the objects in that house, so I did not have many artifacts that could take me back. That day I went on an archeological dig through boxes in my closet to help me remember. I excavated an old cross-country trophy with the plastic label peeling off the front and a black heavyweight frisbee that only really left my closet when I went on vacation. I found my old too-small Timex which, when not attached to my wrist during my time in the old house, was lost. I found my pine-wood derby car that was never fast enough. I only found forgotten objects, not ones that I had remembered or cared to remember. Frantic, I scrolled through Google Photos for answers. A blurry snapshot of my dog on the stairs and a photo of my dad on the basement couch were all I found. You don’t realize how few pictures you take of your own house. After all, how could you forget the posters you taped to the walls? How could you forget the position of your laundry hamper? Can’t you trust yourself? Are you losing it?
I’ve caught myself and now I must testify. Once put on the stand, hand placed on a bible, and asked simple questions, it turns out that eyewitnesses are a weak piece of evidence. Of the approximately 360 cases of wrongful conviction that were subsequently reversed due to DNA evidence, about 71% originally relied on bad witness testimony [1]. The human brain’s adaptability and imagination effect how we remember. Often familiar things can be forgotten because we recall them more frequently. They can become warped as the mind factors in new information and emotions [2]. Memory can become false, but I don’t think it’s a lie, at least not a conscious one. As we take in new information and remember the old, we lose our grip, no matter how tight. The fresh data betrays the old and I forget what was under my twin bed in favor of calculus. Maybe it wasn’t my fault?

I lived in a house in Virginia, but that house doesn’t exist anymore—or at least not how it used to. I sit and write this not to argue or protest, but to deal with the effects of my departure. What else do you do if you can’t go back and you can’t remember? All I have are the memories of it. A building—part dollhouse, part mansion— in my mind with some parts fiction and some parts truth. The reality is that I did not forget in the instant I walked out the door; I forgot slowly and silently as I grew up. I thought nothing would ever change even as the house seemed to shrink, first in space and then in my mind. I outgrew that house because it was time for me to. Every time I went back to the house in my mind, the memory became less and less like the actual place. I don’t know what memories to trust. I don’t think I can trust any of them like I could when the building was still standing. The privilege of enduring so few departures played a trick on me. I didn’t think saying goodbye had a lasting impact in more ways than just physical. 

Still, I don’t regret forgetting. I just wish it wasn’t a part of growing up.
